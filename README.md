## brief context on the DailyReminders.pdf
Ernest Hemingway once said, *"The only kind of writing is rewriting."*

For the quote buffs out there, you may notice many bullets in my daily reminders that have taken ideas and maxims from others and may not be properly attributed or cited in the pdf. In an effort to keep the document no more than 1 page long, I chose to leave out some of the citations in order to prevent text from spilling onto the following page. 

I offer my sincere apologies here. I claim neither credit nor the mental ability to come up with such succint compressions of truths and wisdom on my own. I am merely *standing on the shoulders of giants*. In an effort to make things whole, I will list each full quote and author properly here, in the order they are mentioned in the document...
